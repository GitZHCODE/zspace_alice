**ZSPACE** is a C++  library collection of geometry data-structures and algorithms framework. It is implemented as a header-only C++ library, whose dependencies, are header-only or static libraries. Hence **ZSPACE** can be easily embedded in C++ projects. 

Optionally the library may also be pre-compiled into a statically  or dynamically linked library, for faster compile times.
